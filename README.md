Ludum Dare 26 - April 26th-29th - Theme: Minimalism

### My First Ludum Dare

This is the repository for my entry into LD26. Not only is this my first Ludum Dare, it is also my first game jam.

### Day 1

After struggling to get Moai to do what I wanted, I finally got simple shape outlines to draw as I wanted.

### 22 hours left

Finally got shape drawing and morphing working they way I envisioned. Took way longer than I would have liked, mostly due to being unfamilier with both Lua and Moai. Next I'll be adding player input and a basic level. Possibly hook up some Box2D physics as well, time permitting.

### 20 hours left

Added a MOAI splash screen

### 2 hours left

I got a basic frmaework with proper frontend and backend states. The backend has a Box2D based physics world and the player object is a physics object in that world. Still no real gameplay or proper player mechanics. Pressing the [SPACE] key will jump (fly if repeatedly pressed)

### Complete

Well I didn't make a game but I'm much more familiar with Lua and MOAI now. And I had fun working on this.
