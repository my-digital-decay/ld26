Ludum Dare 26 - April 26th-29th - Theme: Minimalism

### My First Ludum Dare

This is the repository for my entry into LD26. Not only is this my first Ludum Dare, it is also my first game jam.

### Day 1

After struggling to get Moai to do what I wanted, I finally got simple shape outlines to draw as I wanted.
